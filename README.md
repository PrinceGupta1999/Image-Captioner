# Kaptioner
Kaptioner is a Machine Learning based Web App that allows the user to quickly generate precise and accurate Tags i.e "IDENTIFICATION LABELS" based upon the uploaded image and the description. The application includes a network in which users can log into and upload images upon which relevant labels will be generated from the image and description provided. 

## Technology Stack

## Functionalities
* Authentication System - Users can create a New Account, Log In to their pre-existing account using this functionality.
* User Photo Upload - Through this the user can either upload an Image from his machine or even provide us an Image URL.
* Add Description
* User Interaction - Users interact with each other by Commenting on 
 various other pics. this also helps us to generate a Real Time Dynamic set of TRENDING PHOTOS AND TAGS.
 
## Utitlities
The Application will make use of Computer Vision based standard architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks and a dynamic set of TRENDING LABELS to learn in  real time from the inputs provided by the user.
It would help online shopping and e-commerce giants - Flipkarts and the Snapdeals to generate pinpoint and unambiguous labels for each and every product, use them on a platform like the Google AdWords and then recognize and focus on a specific target audience.
Also, we intend to implement the algorithm to perform error-free search operations on a group of products based upon these Identification Labels. It would considerably improve the search functionality on these websites with a large collection of data and heavy traffic.
