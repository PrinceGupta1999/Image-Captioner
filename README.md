# Kaptioner
Kaptioner is a Machine Learning based Web App that allows the user to quickly generate precise and accurate Tags i.e "IDENTIFICATION LABELS" based upon the uploaded image and the description.

### Technology Stack
* MEN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, NodeJs) Stack
* Python
* BootStrap

#### Repository Link for [Computer Vision Model](https://github.com/ishankjain/hackBPIT)

### Functionalities
* User Photo Upload - Through this the user can either upload an Image from his machine.
* Add Description - Users can add a suitable description related to their Image.

### Installation

#### Install Git

### Utitlities
The Application will make use of Computer Vision based standard architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks and a dynamic set of IDENTIFICATION LABELS to learn in  real time from the inputs provided by the user.
It would help online shopping and e-commerce giants - Flipkarts and the Snapdeals to generate pinpoint and unambiguous labels for each and every product, use them on a platform like the Google AdWords and then recognize and focus on a specific target audience.

Also, we intend to implement the algorithm to perform error-free search operations on a group of products based upon these Identification Labels. It would considerably improve the search functionality on these websites with a large collection of data and heavy traffic.
